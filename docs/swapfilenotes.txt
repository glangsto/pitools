This note concerns creating and removing swap files from
a Raspberry PI OS.

Glen Langston 2021 December 9

For some tasks, creating a swap file speeds execution, particulary
for compilation of large blocks of code.

This text comes from page:
https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/InstallingGRFromSource_on_Raspberry_Pi#Set_up_a_swap_file

Create:
=======

sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile

Then  edit /etc/fstab and add this line:

/swapfile  none  swap  sw  0  0


Remove:
=======
Since the Swapfile is large, It may be best to remove it
when it is not needed.

 - edit /etc/fstab and remove the entry for '/swapfile' there (the last line)
 - swapoff /swapfile
 - rm /swapfile
